    <h2 id="AboutMe">About Me!</h2>
    <p id="story">Lets start with the basics. I am Sean Tobias! Born on the 25th day of February in 1992. Yes, that makes
        me 32 years old. Born in Brownsville,Tx a small town and a border city. I've taken on teaching myself to code in the hopes
        of creating a better oppurtunity for my family and I. It's very meaningful to me to provide a life for my son that I didn't have growing
        up. Although, my parents did provide me a good childhood , I see the room for improvement. Who knew having a baby would drive 
        your motivation and ambitions through the roof!
